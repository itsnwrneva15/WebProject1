        <td colspan="2" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><p>Following his historic victory over &ldquo;The Golden Boy&rdquo; Oscar De La Hoya, and his dramatic 10th round knock-out domination over Ricky &ldquo;The Hitman&rdquo; Hatton, Mayweather stunned the entire sports world in June of 2008 when he announced that he was retiring from boxing after competing in the sport for nearly 20 years. Now the former number one pound-for-pound champion is set to return to the sport he loves after 16 months, making his return to the ring for the first time since December 2007.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;My goal has always been to be one of the best fighters who ever lived,&rdquo; Mayweather said. &ldquo;My career and legacy are very important to me. I feel that I am already ranked amongst the greatest and I am back to prove that I belong at the top by fighting and defeating Juan Manuel Marquez.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mayweather was born into a boxing family. His father, Floyd Sr. was a former welterweight contender who fought Hall of Famer Sugar Ray Leonard, and his uncles, Roger and Jeff, were also pro fighters, with Roger &ndash; Floyd&rsquo;s current trainer &ndash; winning two world championships in his prime.</p>
          <p>Fitted with boxing gloves while he was still a toddler, Floyd started boxing at the age of seven, and his acumen for the hardest game was obvious from the start. He would go on to compile an 84-6 amateur record while earning three Michigan Golden Gloves titles, three National Golden Gloves titles, PAL and National Championships, and an Olympic Bronze medal in the 1996 Games.</p>
          <p><strong>He has not lost since.</strong><a name="lost" id="lost"></a></p>
          <p class="cream_table">Turning pro in the super featherweight division on October 11, 1996, Mayweather blitzed Roberto Apodaca in just two rounds, and his journey to greatness was underway. After one more win in 1996, Mayweather went 10-0 with 9 knockouts in 1997, and added five more wins to his ledger in the first half of 1998. Fight fans were chomping at the bit to see the ultra-talented Mayweather in with the elite at 130 pounds, and on October 3, 1998, they got their chance when the 21-year old faced off against Genaro Hernandez for &lsquo;Chicanito&rsquo;s WBC world championship.</p>
          <p>It was no contest as Mayweather battered the veteran with blinding combinations, pitching a near shutout before the fight was stopped after the eighth round. Floyd Mayweather was a world champion.</p>
